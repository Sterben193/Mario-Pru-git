Long ago, there was a kingdom filled with laughter…
and the sweet sound of clinking coins.

In that land, people didn’t measure worth by fame or power —but by how many coins they owned.

Then one day, everything changed.

A strange event known as the “Coinfall” struck the kingdom —raining countless coins across mountains, forests, and caverns.

Along with the coins came monsters —
greedy, twisted creatures born from people’s desire for wealth.

The kingdom fell silent.
Roads emptied.
The brave who ventured out never returned.

Until now.

A wanderer named Rex — not a hero, not a villain —sets out on the greatest coin hunt ever known.

Not to save anyone.
Not to become a legend.

But simply because...

“They say every coin holds a story…
and I happen to love collecting stories.”

With a rusty hammer in hand and worn-out boots on his feet,
Rex steps into a world filled with traps, monsters, and glittering treasures.

The journey begins… Collect. Fight. Survive.
